### Which should you choose?

**Minconda OR Anaconda**

> Note:

 Conda is the package manager (i.e. it displays all the installed packages in the environment.)
Whereas Anaconda and Miniconda are distributions (i.e. they are collection of packages, pre-built and pre-configured, that can be installed and used on a computer system).

Miniconda is essentially an installer for an empty conda environment, containing only Conda, Python and its minimal dependencies. Miniconda is the same as Anaconda, but does not include the complete set, so it is much smaller.

Anaconda is a full distribution of the central software in the Python Data ecosystem, and includes both Python and conda along with additional binaries of several pre-installed packages geared toward scientific computing. 

### **System Requirement for Installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#system-requirements)**

- 1 GB RAM minimum, 4 GB RAM recommended.

- 500 MB of available disk space minimum, 120 GB and above recommended.

- For windows: Microsoft Windows 8.1 or newer (32-bit or 64-bit).

- Support for a Hypervisor and virtualization(used in virtual machines). 


**Choose Miniconda:**


- If you do not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually.
- If you do not have time or disk space to install over 1,500 packages at once.
- If you want fast access to Python and the conda commands and you wish to sort out the other programs later.
    Once you have Miniconda, you can easily install Anaconda into it with this command
 `conda install anaconda` .
 

### **System Requirement for Installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-repository/admin-guide/install/requirements/)**

- 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution.


**Choose Anaconda:**


- If you are new to conda or Python.
- If you like the convenience of having Python and over 1,500 scientific packages automatically installed at once.
- If you do not want to individually install each of the packages you want to use.
- If you wish to use a set of packages structured and examined for interoperability and usability.

Whether you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), select the most recent version.
